# Spring Security RESTful API 🚀

A mini project built with **Spring Boot** and **Spring Security** that demonstrates:

- Building RESTful APIs with CRUD operations
- Implementing authentication & authorization using Spring Security
- Using events & listeners to handle security-related actions (e.g., login success, login failure, token creation)
- Configuring WebConfig for CORS and request handling
- Integrating OAuth2 Authorization Server for secure token-based authentication

## 📌 Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication & Authorization** with Spring Security  
- 🎟️ **JWT/OAuth2 Token generation and validation**  
- 📢 **Custom Events & Event Listeners** for security flows  
- 🛠️ **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)** with `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`, etc.  
- 🌐 **CORS configuration** via WebConfig  
- 🗄️ **Spring Data JPA** for persistence (with H2/MySQL – configurable)  
- 📡 **RESTful API endpoints** for user management and secured resources
